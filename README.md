Documenting steps to complete the Hangman Project

Milestone 1 

I have used Python to write the code in milestone 1. This consists of defining a word list of fruits and implementing the import random function to pick a random fruit from the list. The code also includes an ask user input and if/else statement to check if the user input is a single character.

Key things to remember - the len function is required when calculating the length of a string.
